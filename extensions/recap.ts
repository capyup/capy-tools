// The recap tool is the channel for user-visible narration. Instead of asking
// the model to "write inline prose" — which depends on each provider's habit of
// emitting text vs thinking content — we accept the prose as a tool argument.
// The model only needs to know "to narrate to the user, call recap with text".
// We own the rendering.
//
// Empirically (see commit history and tests/message-shape-diagnostic.test.ts),
// Gemini and Kimi route nearly all their narration into hidden thinking
// traces; Claude tends to emit it as text. A tool-argument channel makes the
// narration uniform regardless of provider.
